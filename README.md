# code-projects contain the various projects i am currently undertaking to both learn Python and also a personal project I will be building as a tool for farming records and a farm manager assistant. 
This is gonna be an awesome journey as everything will be made from a personal point of understanding and implementatiopn but considering we have AI tools that can help with explanations and code optimization, I couldint have chosen a better time to learn and implement this.
