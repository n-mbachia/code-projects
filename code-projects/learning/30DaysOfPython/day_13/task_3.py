"""Using list comprehension create the following list of tuples:"""
list_of_tuple = [(i, 1, i**0, i**1, i**2, i**3, i**4) for i in range(11)]
print(list_of_tuple)
"""
This code works by first iterating over the range of numbers from 0 to 10 using the for loop. For each number, the code then creates a tuple containing the number, 1, and the number raised to the powers of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The code then adds the tuple to the list of tuples.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

list_of_tuple = []: This creates an empty list to store the tuples.
for i in range(11): This iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to 10.
(i, 1, i**0, i**1, i**2, i**3, i**4): This creates a tuple containing the number, 1, and the number raised to the powers of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
list_of_tuple.append((i, 1, i**0, i**1, i**2, i**3, i**4)): This adds the tuple to the list of tuples.
