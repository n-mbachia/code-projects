"""A decorator in Python is a design pattern that allows modifying the behavior of a function or class without modifying its source code. Decorators wrap a function and modify its behavior in one way or another. They are a powerful feature of Python and are widely used in many Python libraries and frameworks.

In Python, a decorator is implemented as a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that adds some additional behavior to the original function. The new function is typically a wrapper around the original function."""
