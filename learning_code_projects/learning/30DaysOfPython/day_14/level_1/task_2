a higher-order function allows a function to be used as a parameter and a return value also 
a closure allows a nested function to access the outer scope of the encolosing function. 
a decorator is a design pattern that allows the user to add new functionality to an exiting object without modifying its structure. a decorator is initiated by having the @ symbol before the decorator name.
